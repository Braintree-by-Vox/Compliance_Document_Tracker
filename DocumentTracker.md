## Managing Documents for Entities
An entity is a master record against which you wish to store and manage documents. This could be a supplier, customer, inventory item, fixed asset, resource or employee.

You can manage the documents via an administration role centre, and you can also view and manage the documents for a particular entity from the relevant master maintenance record.

Make sure that your profile is set to 'Document Manager'. The role centre should look something like this:
